# pands-weekly-tasks

This is the repository of Aoife Flavin. The purpose of this repoitory is to complete the weekly problem sets given in the module Programming and Scripting, in Semester 1 of the Higher Diploma in Data Analytics at ATU.

In each section I will detail my approach to solving the assigned tasks, cite the sources I used while problem-solving, and provide an overview of the technologies used in both code creation and testing.

I have previously completed very basic python training so some tasks did not require extensive research.
