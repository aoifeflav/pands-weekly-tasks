# pands-weekly-tasks

This is the repository of Aoife Flavin. The purpose of this repoitory is to complete the weekly problem sets given in the module Programming and Scripting, in Semester 1 of the Higher Diploma in Data Analytics at ATU.

In each section I will detail my approach to solving the assigned tasks, cite the sources I used while problem-solving, and provide an overview of the technologies used in both code creation and testing.

I have previously completed very basic python training so some tasks did not require extensive research.

### ***Bank***
    Write a program called bank.py 
    The program should:
    a. Prompt the user and read in two money amounts (in cent)
    b. Add the two amounts
    c. Print out the answer in a human readable format with a euro sign and decimal point between the euro and cent of the amount 

### Description:

User call of the program is :

```
λ python bank.py
```
User input :
```
Enter amount one (in cent): 75
Enter amount two (in cent): 99
```
and the output is :

```
The sum of these amounts is: €1.74

    Write a python program called accounts.py that reads in a 10 character account number and outputs the account number         with only the last 4 digits showing (and the first 6 digits replaced with Xs).
    Modify the program to deal with account numbers of any length.

### ***Collatz*** 
    Write a program, called collatz.py, that asks the user to input any positive integer and outputs the successive values         of the following calculation.
    At each step calculate the next value by taking the current value and, if it is even, divide it by two, but if it is         odd, multiply it by three and add one.
    Have the program end if the current value is one.
